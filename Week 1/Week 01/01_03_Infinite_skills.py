# AI for video games NPC and events they will react to everything the player does and what is
# happening in the environment Like SAO(Sword Art Online) but without the whole kill switch 
# in the headset. I would also like to make The Baseline test from Blade Runner 2049, It would
# be a great thing to check on police officer's mental State and to check if they are fit to be 
# on the field or even in the office.
