"""
while working with video games a problem that can occur 
for newcomers is text running off the screen which can be 
Fixed using \n. 

Another problem that can occur is setting a number to an
event/prompt to appear. A mistake that I came across was 
If you put ‘’ to incase your numbers it will only notice the first
For example(age == 34 will be seen as 34 but age == ‘34’ will
be seen as 3)
